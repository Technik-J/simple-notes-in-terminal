# Simple Notes in Terminal

Wrote this terminal tool to help me write notes in terminal. It writes to home directory in a simple markdown file with timestamps. You can change the location in `config_file.py`.

## Install
* Clone this repository.
* Add this aliases. Change path to yours, if you didn't clone to your home directory.
```shell
alias note='/usr/bin/python3 $HOME/simple-notes-in-terminal/simple-notes.py'
alias snote='/usr/bin/python3 $HOME/simple-notes-in-terminal/simple-notes.py --simple'
```

## Example

```shell
$ snote This is a simple note
